Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format 
that is both human-readable and machine-readable. The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability
 over the Internet.It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages. Although the
design of XML focuses on documents, it is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures,for example in web services.
